Stephen J. Mellor (born 1952) is a British computer scientist, developer of the Shlaer–Mellor method and Executable UML, and signatory to the Agile Manifesto.


== Biography ==
Mellor received a BA in computer science from the University of Essex in 1974, and started working at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland as a programmer in BCPL. In 1977 he became software engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and in 1982 consultant at Yourdon, Inc..
At Yourdon in cooperation with Paul Ward they developed the Ward–Mellor method, and published the book-series Structured Development for Real Time Systems in 1985. Together with Sally Shlaer he founded Project Technology in 1985. That company was acquired by Mentor Graphics in 2004. Mellor stayed as chief scientist of the Embedded Systems Division at Mentor Graphics for another two years, and is self-employed since 2006.
Since 1998 Mellor has contributed to the Object Management Group, chairing the consortium that added executable actions to the UML, and the specification of model-driven architecture (MDA). He is also chairing the advisory board of the IEEE Software magazine.
