The International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) is a gathering of artificial intelligence researchers and practitioners. It is organized by the IJCAI, Inc., and has been held biennially in odd-numbered years since 1969. It is sponsored jointly by the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) Organization, and the national AI societie(s) of the host nation(s). IJCAI is a highly selective conference. For instance, only 17% of the papers submitted to the conference were accepted in 2011, and in previous years never more than 26%. This makes it a more selective publication than many AI journals.


== Awards ==
Three research awards are given at each IJCAI conference.
The IJCAI Computers and Thought Award is given to outstanding young scientists in artificial intelligence.
The Donald E. Walker Distinguished Service Award is given to honor senior scientists in AI for contributions and service to the field during their careers.
The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence is given to scientists who have carried out a program of research of consistently high quality throughout an entire career yielding several substantial results.
Additionally, IJCAI presents one or more Best Paper Awards  at the conference to recognize the highest quality papers.
