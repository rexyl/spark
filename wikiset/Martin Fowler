Martin Fowler (born 1963) is a British software engineer, author and international public speaker on software development, specializing in object-oriented analysis and design, UML, patterns, and agile software development methodologies, including extreme programming.
His 1999 book Refactoring popularized the practice of code refactoring. In 2004 he introduced Presentation Model (PM), an architectural pattern.
