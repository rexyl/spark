The Enterprise Unified Process (EUP) is an extended variant of the Unified Process and was developed by Scott W. Ambler and Larry Constantine in 2000, eventually reworked in 2005 by Ambler, John Nalbone and Michael Vizdos. EUP was originally introduced to overcome some shortages of RUP, namely the lack of production and eventual retirement of a software system. So two phases and several new disciplines were added. EUP sees software development not as a standalone activity, but embedded in the lifecycle of the system (to be built or enhanced or replaced), the IT lifecycle of the enterprise and the organization/business lifecycle of the enterprise itself. It deals with software development as seen from the customer's point of view.
In 2013 work began to evolve EUP to be based on Disciplined Agile Delivery instead of the Unified Process.


== PhasesEdit ==
The Unified Process defines four project phases
Inception
Elaboration
Construction
Transition
To these EUP adds two additional phases
Production
Retirement


== DisciplinesEdit ==
The Rational Unified Process defines nine project disciplines
Business Modeling
Requirements
Analysis and Design
Implementation
Test
Deployment
Configuration and Change Management
Project Management
Environment
To these EUP adds one additional project discipline
Operations and Support
and seven enterprise disciplines
Enterprise Business Modeling
Portfolio Management
Enterprise Architecture
Strategic Reuse
People Management
Enterprise Administration
Software Process Improvement


== Best Practices of EUPEdit ==
The EUP provide following best practices:-
Develop iteratively
Manage requirements
Proven architecture
Modeling
Continuously verify quality.
Manage change
Collaborative development
Look beyond development.
Deliver working software on a regular basis
Manage risk
