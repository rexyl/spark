Windermere Real Estate, a real estate company founded and based in the Windermere neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, was founded by John W. Jacobi in 1972, when he purchased an eight-agent office. Still privately held, it is now the largest real estate company in the Pacific Northwest, with over 300 offices and 7,000 agents.
It expanded outside Seattle in 1984 with an office on Bainbridge Island, and ten years later opened offices in British Columbia and Idaho. As of 2004, Windermere does business in Washington, Oregon, California, British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. All Windermere offices are locally owned and operated.
Windermere sponsors the annual Windermere Cup (since 1987) and Cascade Cup (since 2002) crew races in the Montlake Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal.
